This Haskell code uses an unsafePerformIO action within a pure function, which is generally discouraged.  It can lead to unpredictable behavior and break referential transparency, making debugging and reasoning about the code significantly harder.

```haskell
import System.IO

myPureFunction :: Int -> IO Int
myPureFunction x = do
  y <- unsafePerformIO $ getLine >>= return . read
  return (x + y)
```
